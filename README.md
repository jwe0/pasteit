## Legal
This service does not directly store any information of users. Due to the
nature of providing an anonymous service there is potential for users to post
illegal or harmful content.

While I fully support free speech any posts that violate laws around child safety
will be removed, any other posts, regardless of content will remain on my platform
unless there are clear legal reasons as to why I should remove it.

I do not support nor condone activites such as doxing, fraud or any kind of 
cybercrime. However I will stand firm on protecting my users right to free speech.

Although I do not store any information on users the services I use (vercel, supabse etc)
may collect telemetary data, because of this reason I recommend using a privacy
focused browser alongside Tor or a good VPN for example Mullvad.

Any and all requests from law enforcement agencies for user information will be
disregarded unless you can clearly show me how the user on my service is linked
with your investigation.
